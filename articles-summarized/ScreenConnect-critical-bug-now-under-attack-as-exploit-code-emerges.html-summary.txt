Cybersecurity company Huntress analyzed the vulnerabilities and warned that developing an exploit is a trivial task. The first working exploits emerged quickly after ConnectWise announced the two vulnerabilities, and more continue to be published. An assessment from The ShadowServer Foundation noted that yesterday the number of vulnerable ScreenConnect servers was around 3,800.
