 The CISA, FBI, and EPA have shared a list of defense measures U.S. water utilities should implement to better secure their systems against cyberattacks. The fact sheet published outlines the top eight actions U.S. Water and Wastewater Systems (WWS) sector organizations can take to reduce cyberattack risks. These include reducing exposure of key assets to the public-facing internet, conducting regular cybersecurity assessments, changing default or insecure passwords, implementing multifactor authentication, creating inventories of OT/IT assets, regularly backing up systems for easier recovery, patching or mitigating known vulnerabilities, developing and exercising incident response plans, and conducting annual cybersecurity awareness training. Water facilities have been repeatedly targeted by cyberattacks in recent years, compromising the security of critical infrastructure and raising concerns about public safety.
