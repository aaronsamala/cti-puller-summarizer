 Security researchers found a new malware campaign called 'Migo' that targets Redis servers on Linux hosts. Migo disables critical security features in the Redis server and uses system-weakening commands to mine for cryptocurrency. The attacker has a strong understanding of the Redis environment and operations, and can potentially use access to deliver more dangerous payloads.
