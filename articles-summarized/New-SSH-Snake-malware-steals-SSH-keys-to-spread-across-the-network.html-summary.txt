 A threat actor is using an open-source network mapping tool called SSH-Snake to search for private keys and move laterally on the victim's infrastructure. This worm stands out from traditional SSH worms by avoiding detectable patterns associated with scripted attacks, which makes it more stealthy and efficient. SSH-Snake is designed for versatility and allows customization for specific operational needs. It has been used offensively on around 100 victims and is seen as an evolutionary step in malware that targets secure connection methods widely used in corporate environments.
