 The U.S. State Department is offering rewards up to $15 million for information about LockBit ransomware gang members and their associates, with $10 million for identifying the leadership and $5 million for apprehending affiliates. The department has a dedicated Tor SecureDrop server for anonymous tips submission. This follows the recent arrest of two Lockbit affiliates in Poland and Ukraine, as well as the release of a free decryptor developed using over 1,000 decryption keys retrieved from seized servers.
