 VMware is urging administrators to remove a discontinued authentication plugin that is vulnerable to authentication relay and session hijack attacks. The Enhanced Authentication Plug-in (EAP) enables seamless login to vSphere's management interfaces via integrated Windows Authentication and Windows-based smart card functionality on Windows client systems. The vulnerabilities can be used by malicious attackers to relay Kerberos service tickets and take over privileged EAP sessions. To address the security flaws, admins have to remove both the in-browser plugin/client (VMware Enhanced Authentication Plug-in 6.7.0) and the Windows service (VMware Plug-in Service). As an alternative to this vulnerable auth plug-in, VMware advises admins to use other VMware vSphere 8 authentication methods such as Active Directory over LDAPS, Microsoft Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS), Okta, and Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD).
