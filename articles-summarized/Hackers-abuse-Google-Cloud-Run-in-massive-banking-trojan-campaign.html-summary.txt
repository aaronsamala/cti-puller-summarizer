 Security researchers are warning that hackers have been abusing the Google Cloud Run service to distribute banking trojans like Astaroth, Mekotio, and Ousaban. Google Cloud Run allows users to deploy frontend and backend services, websites or applications without managing infrastructure or scaling. Cisco Talos researchers observed a massive uptick in the misuse of Google's service for malware distribution starting September 2023, with Brazilian actors launching campaigns using MSI installer files to deploy malware payloads. The report notes that Google Cloud Run has become attractive to cybercriminals due to its cost-effectiveness and ability to bypass standard security blocks and filters. Attackers use phishing emails to lure potential victims, crafted to appear as legitimate communications for invoices, financial statements, or messages from local government and tax agencies. The emails contain links redirecting to malicious web services hosted on Google Cloud Run, leading to the delivery of payloads via MSI files or 302 redirects to a Google Cloud Storage location. The banking trojans Astaroth/Guildma, Mekotio, and Ousaban are used in these campaigns to steal sensitive financial data for taking over banking accounts. Google has removed the offending links and is looking into strengthening its mitigation efforts to help prevent this type of nefarious activity.
