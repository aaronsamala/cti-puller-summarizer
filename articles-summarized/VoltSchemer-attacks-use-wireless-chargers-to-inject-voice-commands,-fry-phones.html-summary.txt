 A new set of attacks called "VoltSchemer" can inject voice commands to manipulate a smartphone's voice assistant through the magnetic field emitted by an off-the-shelf wireless charger. These attacks are possible due to security flaws in the hardware design of wireless charging systems and their communication protocols. VoltSchemer can also cause physical damage to the mobile device and heat items close to the charger to a temperature above 536F (280C). The researchers demonstrated this by injecting voltage fluctuations to interfere with the charging process, causing overheating, overcharging, and damaging electronic items. They also showed that it is possible to inject voice commands through noise signals transmitted over the charging station's range, achieving call initiation, browsing a website, or launching an app. These discoveries highlight security gaps in modern charging stations and standards, and call for better designs that are more resilient to electromagnetic interference.
