 Two Chinese nationals have been caught and convicted of submitting over 5,000 fake iPhones worth more than $3 million to Apple with the goal of having them replaced with genuine devices. They took advantage of Apple's one-year warranty policy and its insurance protection plans, which allow customers to return malfunctioning devices for a replacement or extend the warranty period beyond one year. Between July 2017 and December 2019, they shipped counterfeit devices from Hong Kong to commercial mail receiving agency (CMRA) mailboxes in UPS stores and submitted them with spoofed serial numbers and IMEI numbers to Apple retail stores and Apple Authorized Service Providers. They received replacement iPhones from Apple, which were then shipped to the conspirators in Hong Kong to sell and share the illegally obtained funds between the scheme's members.
