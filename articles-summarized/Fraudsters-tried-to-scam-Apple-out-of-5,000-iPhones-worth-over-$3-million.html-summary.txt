 Two Chinese men, Haotian Sun and Pengfei Xue, were caught and convicted of submitting over 5,000 fake iPhones worth more than $3 million to Apple with the goal of having them replaced with genuine devices. They took advantage of Apple's policy to replace non-functioning counterfeit devices by shipping counterfeit devices from Hong Kong to commercial mail receiving agency (CMRA) mailboxes in UPS stores, opening using their actual driver's licenses and university identification cards, submitting the inauthentic iPhones with spoofed serial numbers and IMEI numbers to Apple retail stores and Apple Authorized Service Providers, receiving replacement iPhones from Apple, shipped via private and commercial interstate carriers, including FedEx, DLH, and UPS. These replacement devices were then shipped to the conspirators in Hong Kong to sell and share the illegally obtained funds between the scheme's members. Sun and Xue each face a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison.
