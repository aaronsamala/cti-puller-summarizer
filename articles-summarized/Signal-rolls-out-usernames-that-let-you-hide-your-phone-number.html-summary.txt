 Signal, the end-to-end encrypted messaging app, now allows users to choose custom usernames in order to protect their phone number privacy. This update is part of a beta rollout that follows a public test phase and aims to make phone number privacy easy and useful for everyone. Users can create a username that can be used to contact them in Settings > Profile. Once the new username is set up, users no longer have to disclose their phone number and can share a unique link or QR code with people they want to start a quick chat with. Signal has also introduced an optional privacy setting that requires contacts who want to connect on Signal to use the username instead of the phone number.
